      Recognizing the importance of information in todayâ€™s knowledge-based
      society driven by information technology and with the need to create
      proper institutional and legal framework for a sound and holistic
      development of the information and communication technology (ICT) sectors
      in the Kingdom, the Royal Government created the Ministry of Information
      and Communications in 2003 through bifurcation of the erstwhile Ministry
      of Communications with the aim to tap the potential of rapid change in the
      field of information and communications technology (ICT) and cater to the
      policy and regulatory needs of the information, communications and media
      sector in the country.
